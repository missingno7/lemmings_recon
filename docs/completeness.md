# Reconstruction completeness

Main-image identity is established. Full static, C and native completion are not.

The decoded instruction denominator is incomplete: unknown runs in the main and
sound-driver images may add executable bytes. Entry candidates include historical leads,
shared tails and manually investigated code; they are not proven disjoint functions.
The complete region partition labels uncertainty rather than claiming classification.
There are 1,567 main-image decoded instructions expressed as explicit encoding exceptions.

Gate A passes for the main EXE: deterministic static unpack, full byte comparison,
63 independently checked relocations, entry/stack state and input identity. Gate B
has an exact buildable initial ASM image, but remains open for code/data, indirect
transfer, external-driver and semantic closure. Gates C/D have only the checksum
cluster: both routines are TESTED within docs/checksum.md's domain; all other main
entry candidates are UNTRANSLATED. CS:8363 reachability remains UNRESOLVED despite
its complete bounded instruction/branch coverage. Gate E is not started.

The checksum tests execute 44/44 cluster instruction addresses and all 10 static
branch edges. They compare registers, defined flags and the entire 1 MiB memory,
including push/pop residue, across poisoned fixtures. AF is excluded only on the
phase-wrap path, where the last XOR makes it architecturally undefined.

Loaded sound-component images reconstruct exactly, with separate static accounting:

| Image | Exact ASM bytes | Classified bytes | Decoded instructions | Entry candidates | Unresolved transfers | C routines |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| adlib | 22,125 | 1,438 | 655 | 17 | 1 | 0 |
| tandysnd | 21,702 | 1,890 | 754 | 40 | 1 | 0 |
| pcspeaker | 758 | 596 | 89 | 4 | 1 | 0 |

Across all four component images, 127,491 ASM bytes are exact and 17,291
instructions have been decoded. C differential coverage remains 44 / 17,291
(0.254%) of this still-incomplete decoded inventory. Six bounded
DAT extraction checks exercise 145 main-image instructions; these are extractor
verification, not C translation coverage and not driver execution tests.

All 16 legacy AdLib signatures at segment 2911 match the static extraction. The
seventeenth external lead is F000:FF53 firmware/environment code, not a driver entry.
All three sound dispatch tables lack sufficient bounds checks; their out-of-table paths
remain unresolved. Driver code/data closure and behavioral translation are open.
Main INT3 protection has independently checked state-specific views: 372 stream
instructions (325 TF-on, 47 TF-off) and 29 transformed INT1 instructions. The
original handlers pass 19 constructed-frame cases and checks at every one of the
325 derived TF-on instruction points, comparing full memory, registers and defined
flags. These checks execute only 61 handler instruction sites; the disk-check body
has not been executed. The two raw-image control frontiers remain represented in
the separate protection CFG. Platform contracts, memory aliases and skipped code
still need review; see protection.md. No protected routine has been translated to C.
No public executable or proprietary asset is tracked. See executable.md for local
provenance, control-frontier.json for addresses, and next-work.md for proof obligations.

Callback evidence traces all 32 recovered object-record pointer stores to nine
drawing callback slots and identifies four display probes, three input callbacks
and the code-input BP callback. The 18 known indirect edges are present in the CFG,
while all five near-callback target domains remain explicitly incomplete. Thirty-two
bounded caller fixtures cover 214 original caller instruction sites with declared
callee boundaries. They check routing and save/restore behavior, including DF-set
traversal and unlisted live pointers; they are not C coverage or callee tests.
See indirect-callbacks.md for alias and incoming-state obligations.

The PC-speaker image is MAIN.DAT section 5: 758 separately reconstructed payload
bytes loaded over canonical zeros at main 08420..08715. Component byte totals count
both stored main bytes and the payload image; they are not unique runtime-memory
bytes. Original extraction is checked at the actual overlay destination at two loads.
The payload's trailing 161 bytes and single pre-entry byte remain UNKNOWN.

Two saved INT08 chains now have explicit external IRET edges and original return
continuations. Nineteen bounded tail cases check complete memory and saved-register/
flag results across loads, stack wrap and external clobbers. Nineteen installed-
handler fixtures check 0F6F/0F70/18F8 and their declared service boundaries. These
are caller/handler checks, not full timer, BIOS, C or game execution coverage.
See interrupts.md for provider contracts and the menu wrapper's unsaved ES effect.
